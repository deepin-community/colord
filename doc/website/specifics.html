<h2>Mapping the device to the profile</h2>

<p>
The configuration of devices to profiles is stored in the colord mapping
database, which is <code>/var/lib/colord/mapping.db</code> by default.
The schema is really simple, and as follows:
</p>
<pre>
CREATE TABLE mappings (id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,device TEXT,profile TEXT, timestamp INTEGER DEFAULT 0);
</pre>

<p>
Multiple profiles can of course be assigned to the same device.
Persistent devices and profiles can also be saved to the storage database,
which is <code>/var/lib/colord/storage.db</code> by default.
The schema is again really simple, and as follows:
</p>
<pre>
CREATE TABLE devices (device_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,device TEXT);
CREATE TABLE properties (device_id TEXT,property TEXT,value TEXT);
</pre>

<h2>Setting the system default</h2>
<p>
One user may want to set the default for all users.
We cannot reference files in <code>/home/foo/.icc/</code> when logged in
as user bar, as the user will not have access permissions, or in the
worst case, <code>/home/foo</code> may be encrypted and inaccessible even as root.
For this reason, colord copies the ICC profiles to a system-wide directory,
<code>/usr/lib/color</code> that is per-machine and accessible to all users.

<p>
It is <a href="http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/openicc/2010q2/002167.html">encouraged</a> that other CMS implementations also read ICC profiles from the per-machine
<code>/usr/lib/color</code> directory.

<h1>General points:</h1>

<p>
I think most of the CMM functionality can be (and should be) integrated
into the platform, e.g. <a href="http://www.gtk.org/">GTK</a> and Cairo.
</p>
<p>
It's my opinion that it's best to have two different applications for
something that share a common specification, rather than trying to be
a jack-of-all-trades.
It's a clich√©, but KDE users do want options, and GNOME users do want
things to 'just work'.
You can't design a library, or even an application for those different
user types.
</p>
<p>
I do think the concept of a <i>monolithic CMS</i> is flawed.
Color management has to be integral to the stack, so Xorg, GTK, Cairo,
etc. all have to play their part.
You can't really push a monolithic library when you need to interface
with so many parts of the stack.
I see all the heavy lifting being done by cairo, lcms and
<a href="http://www.argyllcms.com/">ArgyllCMS</a>.
