  [ Simon McVittie ]
  * d/control: Depend on polkitd | policykit-1, not just policykit-1.
    This allows colord to be installed without pulling in the transitional
    package policykit-1, which in turn is enough to avoid policykit-1 being
    included in new bookworm installations of GNOME, KDE Plasma and Xfce.
    (Closes: #1025554, #1025379)
  * d/tests/installed-tests: Fix autopkgtest failure if polkitd-pkla is
    not installed.
    Installing policykit-1 is no longer guaranteed to provide support for
    the legacy .pkla rules language.
  * d/control: Build-depend on libjson-glib-dev.
    This works around a missing dependency by libgusb-dev (see #1032183)
    and can be reverted when that bug is fixed.

    - Add symbols new in this version
  * debian/source/local-options:
  * debian/patches/series:
  * .gitignore:
    - Set single-debian-patch, and ignore it in git.  This makes cherry-picking
      from upstream cleaner: the patch lands in debian-patches, and disappears
      when we grab the upstream version containing the cherry-pick.
  * debian/patches/01_fix_colord_sane.diff, pre-cherry-picked from upstream.
    - Fixes issues with DBus spawning colord-sane, and with colord-sane
      communicating with colord when run as the colord user

colord (0.1.16-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/colord.postinst:

      colord user actually exists.  (Closes: 658353)
  * debian/colord.install:
  * debian/rules:

colord (0.1.16-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    - Drop 01_use_polkit_owner_annotation.patch; included upstream.
  * debian/colord.postrm:
    - Remove /var/lib/colord on purge; package is now puiparts clean.
  * debian/colord.postinst:
    - Create /var/lib/colord if necessary; we can not rely on adduser creating
      this directory if the user has previously purged colord.
    - Quieten needless output from adduser.

colord (0.1.15-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules:
    + Pass --disable-examples to configure; we don't ship them, and they add
      an unnecessary Build-Dependancy on libdbus-1-dev.  Really fixes the
      kFreeBSD build. (Closes: 652427)

  * debian/control:
  * debian/rules:
  * debian/colord.install:

      - Restrict sane and gudev to linux-any.
      - Use libusb2-dev on kfreebsd-any.

colord (0.1.15-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    + Fixes sqlite injection vulnerability, preventing malicious applications
      from corrupting colord's database (Closes: #650021).
  * debian/patches/01_use_polkit_owner_annotation.patch:
    + Cherry-pick from upstream, enabling use of the PolicyKit "owner"
      annotation.
  * debian/control:
    + Add versioned Build-Depends on libpolkit-gobject-1-dev to ensure
      configure detects a new enough PolicyKit to enable the "owner"
      annotation.
    + Add versioned Depends on policykit-1 to colord to ensure a new enough
      PolicyKit to understand the "owner" annotation at runtime.
  * debian/rules:
    + Re-enable PolicyKit support now that the "owner" annotation is supported.
  * debian/patches/06_use_dbus_security_for_permissions.diff:
    + Drop; PolicyKit has been fixed.
  * debian/libcolord1.symbols: Add new symbols in 0.1.14 and 0.1.15

colord (0.1.13-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Christopher James Halse Rogers ]
  * New upstream release. (Closes: #643724)
  * Update libcolord1 symbols for new upstream.
  * debian/colord.postinst:
  * debian/rules:
    + Run colord daemon as a system user, rather than root.  It only needs
      write access to /var/lib/colord and access to scanner devices, which
      is handled by udev.
  * debian/rules:
  * debian/patches/07_fix_disable_polkit_build.diff:
  * debian/patches/06_use_dbus_security_for_permissions.diff:
    + Use DBus' at_console context to regulate access to the colord daemon.
      PolicyKit doesn't allow non-root processes to query whether a different
      a user is authorised to perform an action.  DBus' at_console context
      duplicates the existing PolicyKit policy.
  * debian/control:
    + Fix typo in package description.  (Closes: #640525)
  * debian/control:
    + Add missing liblcms2-dev, libdbus-1-dev, libglib2.0-dev dependencies to
      libcolord-dev, to fix FTBFS of reverse dependencies.

  [ Sjoerd Simons ]
  * New upstream release (0.1.13) (Closes: #643724)
  * debian/patches/07_fix_disable_polkit_build.diff:
    + Removed, fixed upstream
  * debian/libcolord1.symbols: Update symbols for 0.1.13
